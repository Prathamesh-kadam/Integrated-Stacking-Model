# Integrated-Stacking-Model
this advanced deep learning model form a new form reform in the field of SAR image processing and Classification which can be used in the missions like NISAR which was in join collaboration with ISRO and NASA. This model adresses the drawbacks of individual ML models in classification and makes it more robust to classify more complex SAR data.
